Various improvements to vanilla's loadout system.
- Adds up to 6 more loadout slots (amount can be configured).
- Adds items that let you copy accessories equipped in other loadouts (known as Loadout Voodoo Dolls; search for them in Recipe Browser).

Note: Make sure you remove all items from the loadout slots before disabling the mod! Loadout menus 4 through 6 are only accessible while this mod is enabled.

Links to a GitHub and Discord can be found on the workshop page.
